# OpenFrafsually.Desktop
A modern, fast, and maintainable replacement for Frafs Bench Viewer.

## Why OpenFrafsually was created

Frafs Bench Viewer has been abandoned, much like Fraps, and it hasn't seen new code since 2014. It is programmed in VB6 and is currently unmaintainable since VB6 is not supported, no longer widely used, and lacks the infrastructure to support updating Frafs in a meaningful fashion.


### Some other concerns about Frafs Bench Viewer

Frafs Bench Viewer is also licensed under the GPLv3. The FSF and others characterize the GPL as a license that gives users freedoms, I (AluminiumTech) take a different view that the GPL does not give users who are developers freedoms but rather takes away freedoms from users who are developers.

I (AluminiumTech) am not against Open Source, but the GPL has been used more recently among other things to punish Open Source and to force people into paying for a project to have a dual licensing approach with either much less burdensome requirements or a proprietary license to avoid open source requirements altogether.

Neither the idea of letting people profit off of hardwork and selling somebody else's work off as their own nor Companies or individuals dual licensing a project under GPL and a commercial proprietary license to make money are ideal and the OpenFrafsually project will find a solution so as to respect the work of contributors without forcing people into a greedy dystopia of choosing to sacrifice their code for the "greater good" or forking over cash to avoid this pointless sacrifice. At no point should money have to change hand to get a more favorable license.
